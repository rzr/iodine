iodine (0.6.0~rc1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't source /etc/default/iodine in config script but read out the values
    with awk. This allows to use shell constructs like $() in the file and
    preserve them during re-configuration (closes: #612723).
    Thanks to "Debian bug at v.nix.is" for the bug report.
  * Add a logcheck filter; thanks to martin f krafft for the bug report and
    the logcheck file (closes: #612721).
  * Add patch armel_ftbfs.patch: Rename struct user to struct _user in the
    code to avoid naming conflict caused by including <sys/user.h> as part of
    the armel build. Taken from Ubuntu; not needed currently in Debian but
    saves Ubuntu from carrying the patch and might be helpful later.
